**Openâ€‘source, Excelâ€‘backed algorithm that ranks care providers (0â€¯â€“â€¯100â€¯pts) by live availability, response speed, credential verification, reviews, and other clientâ€‘centric factors.**

## Why use it?
* **Transparent.** Every weight, threshold, and formula lives in plain text (Markdownâ€¯+â€¯CSV/XLS).  
* **Dropâ€‘in.** Works in Excel, Google Sheets, or can be imported into code (Python, JS, etc.).  
* **Clientâ€‘first.** Prioritises the attributes that matter most to people seeking helpâ€”speed, trust, and fit.  
* **Brandâ€‘agnostic.** No companyâ€‘specific hardâ€‘coding; adapt weights to your own platform in minutes.

## How it works

### Gate logic
| Gate | Rule | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | â‰¥â€¯1 bookable slot in next 7â€¯days | Filters out unavailable providers |
| 2 | Autoâ€‘verified license/credential | Ensures baseline trust |
| 3 | Split list into **Verified** vs **Nonâ€‘Verified** | Keeps unverified options visible but clearly separated |

After passing the gates, providers are scored (0â€“100) on nine factors and sorted highâ€‘toâ€‘low within their group.

### Scoring factors

| # | Factor | Max pts |
|---|--------|--------:|
| 1 | Availabilityâ€¯(7â€‘day open slots) | 20 |
| 2 | Response speedâ€¯(hours) | 15 |
| 3 | Credentials verified | 15 |
| 4 | Sessionâ€‘length options | 10 |
| 5 | Languages supported | 10 |
| 6 | Client reviews | 10 |
| 7 | Talkâ€¯Now availability | 10 |
| 8 | Slidingâ€‘scale pricing |Â 5 |
| 9 | Community affiliation |Â 5 |
| Â  | **Total** | **100** |

Formulas for each factor live in **`Defaultâ€‘Sortâ€‘Algorithmâ€‘v2.2.md`**.

## Quick start

| Want toâ€¦ | Do this |
|----------|---------|
| **Open defaultâ€‘sort.csv in Excel** | 1) Clone / download repo.<br>2) Open `default-sort.csv`.<br>3) Replace sample data in columnâ€¯A with your provider list; scores populate automatically. |
| **Use in code** | 1) `pip install pandas` (or similar).<br>2) `df = pandas.read_csv("default-sort.csv")`.<br>3) Apply the formulas in `Default-Sort-Algorithm-v2.2.md` or translate them to SQL / pandas. |

## Files in this repo
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `default-sort.csv` | Clean, diffâ€‘friendly data & weights (can be loaded anywhere). |
| `Defaultâ€‘Sortâ€‘Algorithmâ€‘v2.2.md` | Full spec: gate rules, weight rationale, formula breakdown. |
| (optional) `examples/` | Worked samples or unitâ€‘test fixtures if you add them later. |
